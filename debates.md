# Assignment: Debates

**The Art and Science of Empirical Computer Science (Fall 2022)**

Throughout the semester we'll be engaging in a number of structured discussions (i.e., "debates") focused on specific topics, illustrated with two contrary positions.
These are designed to introduce you to different "styles" of research and how you might allocate effort across different research activities.
Time is zero sum, and there are opportunity costs to everything.
There are no right answers, and there are many different ways to succeed.
The goal of these exercises is to help you think about what type of researcher you want to become.

Here are the debate topics:

+ Topic 1: How should we evaluate excellence? Quality _only_ or quality _and_ quantity?
  + Position A: Researchers should be evaluated _solely_ on the quality of their publications. Quantity is irrelevant and we shouldn't even bother counting.
  + Position B: Researchers should be evaluated on _both_ the quality _and_ quantity of their publications. High-quality publications are of course important, but quantity is also an important component of excellence.
+ Topic 2: Should you collaborate or not?
  + Position A: Early-stage researchers should actively seek out collaborations beyond their research group. Participation in multiple research projects across many different groups builds breadth.
  + Position B: Early-stage researchers should _not_ actively seek out collaborations beyond their research group. Focusing on depth is more important than breadth.
+ Topic 3: How should you approach open-sourcing computational artifacts associated with your work?
  + Position A: Early-stage researchers should do the minimal in open-sourcing computational artifacts that arise from their work. Doing anything more than the community norm is a waste of time and effort that could be better spent writing more papers.
  + Position B: Early-stage researchers should actively promote the adoption of computational artifacts that arise from their work, for example, contributing to popular open-source libraries. Even if this requires a lot of time (e.g., refactoring code into a production-ready state), such efforts are worthwhile.

So as to ensure that all students enrolled have a chance to participate, I'll add more debate topics later in the semester.

## General Structure

I will moderate each debate, which will last approximately 45-60 minutes, with the following overall structure:

+ At the beginning, I'll ask the audience (i.e., students who are not debate participants) for an indication of their position.
+ Each side will be given 10 minutes for an opening statement to advocate for their position. I expect everyone on each side to contribute to the opening statement. Feel free to use slides if you wish.
+ Each side will then be given 5 minutes for a rebuttal. It is fine for a single individual to deliver the rebuttal, but contributions from everyone on the team are of course welcome. No slides here.
+ The audience and moderator will then pose questions to both sides: each side will be given 3 minutes to respond. Time for additional follow-ups will be allowed by the moderator as appropriate. I expect participation from everyone on both sides (across questions); that is, I do not want a single person from each side to be answering every question.
+ At the end, I'll ask the audience again for an indication of their position, to gauge if the debate has changed their mind.

## Preparation and Expectations

As a debate participant, I expect your team to have prepared a coherent and convincing opening statement that advocates for your position.
It is not required that you actually "believe in" your position personally, but you must represent it to the best of your abilities.
Per above, it is expected that everyone on the team participates in delivering the opening statement, so you'll have to divide up your time in a way that makes sense.
Furthermore, I expect your team to have grappled with the pros and cons of _both_ positions: this will be necessary for you to deliver a coherent and convincing rebuttal.
You are not limited in terms of the material you can draw from to make your arguments.
Naturally, assigned course material will be relevant, but there are lots of advice and opinions on the web that can inform your preparations.
Prior to the debate session, my advice is that each team member first work independently, and then arrange a sync up session to discuss high-level strategy, who delivers which arguments, etc.

For the audience (i.e., students who are not debate participants), I expect you to be more than a passive observer listening to both sides.
I expect that you spend a bit of time thinking about both positions prior to the session, reflect on how the issues might apply to your personal career development, and in this process, come up with a list of questions that you can ask in the debate.
