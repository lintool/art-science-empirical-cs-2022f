## Logistics

## Course Description

Graduate students in computer science aspire to "do computer science" (research), but what exactly does that mean?
It involves, among a multitude of activities, reading papers, learning the "state of the art", advancing knowledge, writing papers, and (hopefully) getting them published.
Graduate students learn how to do these things under tutelage of professors, but rarely is there explicit or deliberate instruction on these myriad activities.
With a focus on _empirical_ computer science, this course covers elements that comprise the research enterprise, synthesizing both "art" &mdash; personal experiences I have accumulated over the years &mdash; as well as "science" &mdash; insights derived from quantitative analyses.
The hope is that knowledge and actionable advice from this course will help graduate students better understand research, hopefully leading to more productive and fulfilling careers.

Material for this course will draw from ["The Science of Science"](https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science) by Wang and Barabási, academic papers, as well as other sources on the web.

## Scope

Context is important.
Most of the questions and issues we grapple with in this course have no simple answer.
Nearly always, it depends on context.
As such, it is important to properly scope the coverage of this course.

Wang and Barabási attempt to paint broad strokes with their work, encompassing all of science.
However, some of their findings and recommendations may seem at odds with realities in computer science.
Much of the "art" (e.g., advice, best practices, etc.) covered in this course is drawn from my personal experience, which will of course be colored by my own background.
I am a computer scientist (actually, also a formal linguist) by training, and I work presently at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR), although over the years I have dabbled in other sub-disciplines of computer science as well.

For lack of a better term, I characterize the focus of this course as "empirical computer science", but it really is a shorthand for "stuff that I have worked on" and "stuff that I am familiar with".
NLP and IR can be characterized as "applied machine learning", so perhaps that's a more accurate scope.
The contents of this course will certainly be relevant to graduate students wishing to pursue these topics, and I suspect for related sub-disciplines in computer science such as data mining, or even perhaps computer vision (although I don't work in those fields).
However, I am quite certain that portions of this course will _not_ apply to, for example, theoretical machine learning and complexity.
All findings, advice, recommendations, etc. need to be properly contextualized.

## Detailed Schedule

### Week 1: Introduction

**Slides:** [[PDF](slides/week1.pdf)]

For more details on normative vs. positive approaches, Wikipedia provides a good starting point: [Positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism) and [Normativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normativity).

### Week 2: The Science of Career

**Readings** (to be completed prior to the class session): ["The Science of Science"](https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science) by Wang and Barabási, Part 1: The Science of Career (pages 5-80).

**Slides:** [[PDF](slides/week2.pdf)]

We'll be having our debate on Topic 1: How should we evaluate excellence? Quality _only_ or quality _and_ quantity?

+ Position A: Researchers should be evaluated _solely_ on the quality of their publications. Quantity is irrelevant and we shouldn't even bother counting.
+ Position B: Researchers should be evaluated on _both_ the quality _and_ quantity of their publications. High-quality publications are of course important, but quantity is also an important component of excellence.

### Week 3: The Science of Collaboration

**Readings** (to be completed prior to the class session): ["The Science of Science"](https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science) by Wang and Barabási, Part 2: The Science of Collaboration (pages 81-158).

**Slides:** [[PDF](slides/week3.pdf)]

We'll be having our debate on Topic 2: Should you collaborate or not?

+ Position A: Early-stage researchers should actively seek out collaborations beyond their research group. Participation in multiple research projects across many different groups builds breadth.
+ Position B: Early-stage researchers should _not_ actively seek out collaborations beyond their research group. Focusing on depth is more important than breadth.

### Week 4: The Science of Impact

**Readings** (to be completed prior to the class session): ["The Science of Science"](https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science) by Wang and Barabási, Part 1: The Science of Impact (pages 159-219).

**Slides:** [[PDF](slides/week4.pdf)]

We'll be having our debate on Topic 3: How should you approach open-sourcing computational artifacts associated with your work?

+ Position A: Early-stage researchers should do the minimal in open-sourcing computational artifacts that arise from their work. Doing anything more than the community norm is a waste of time and effort that could be better spent writing more papers.
+ Position B: Early-stage researchers should actively promote the adoption of computational artifacts that arise from their work, for example, contributing to popular open-source libraries. Even if this requires a lot of time (e.g., refactoring code into a production-ready state), such efforts are worthwhile.

### Week 5: Presentation of Visualization Projects

Presentation of visualization projects!

### Week 6: The Science of Impact (Still)

**Slides:** [[PDF](slides/week6.pdf)]

We'll be having our debate on Topic 4: Is social media a waste of time?
  + Position A: Early-stage researchers should actively incorporate social media use as a component of their career development. This means appropriate use of sites like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn to build professional reputation, engage with the community, hear about recent work by others, etc.
  + Position B: Early-stage researchers should stay off social media. It's a complete waste of time.
